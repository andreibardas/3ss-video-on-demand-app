**RUN APP LOCALLY:**

Due to the fact that the issuer ".3rdy.tv" does not have an SSL certificate, please disable verification from your browser for this address.

Easiest way to do that (Google Chrome example):

1. Access **video-proxy.3rdy.tv**
2. Go to "**Advanced**"
3. Click on "**Proceed to video-proxy.3rdy.tv (unsafe)**"
4. **Refresh.** You should now get data from the server



Open the project in a new terminal and run:

**npm i**

**npm start**

The app is now live on "http://localhost:3000/" ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰





NPM version: **6.14.15**
